To handle the validation 

### 1. **Bulk Fetch of Existing Data**:
   Before you start processing the 100,000 car entries, fetch the existing car models and brands in bulk from the database and store them in memory (e.g., in a `Set` or `Map`). This will avoid querying the database for each individual entry, which would be inefficient.

   - Fetch all existing car brands and models with a single query like:
     ```sql
     SELECT brand, model FROM car_models;
     ```
   - Store the results in a `Set` (for uniqueness checks) or a `Map` (for more complex lookups):
     - A `Map[String, Set[String]]` where the key is the brand and the value is a set of models for that brand.

### 2. **Use Batching for Inserts**:
  

   - Use JDBCâ€™s batch functionality to insert multiple entries at once, say 500 or 1000 at a time.
   - Example:
     ```sql
     INSERT INTO car_models (brand, model, year, description) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?);
     ```
     Execute this in batches using prepared statements.

### 3. **Transaction Handling**:
   Make sure to wrap your inserts inside a transaction to avoid the overhead of committing each insert individually. This also ensures that the batch operation is atomic.

### 4. **Concurrency**:
   You can split the processing into multiple threads, each processing a subset of the 100,000 entries. With HikariCP managing the connection pool, multiple threads can perform database operations concurrently without overloading the database.

### Example of Efficient Flow:
Here is a step-by-step outline of how you can implement this in your Scala program:

1. **Fetch existing brands and models in memory**:
   ```scala
   import scala.collection.mutable
   import java.sql.{Connection, DriverManager, ResultSet}

   def fetchExistingModels(connection: Connection): Map[String, Set[String]] = {
     val statement = connection.createStatement()
     val resultSet: ResultSet = statement.executeQuery("SELECT brand, model FROM car_models")
     val existingModels = mutable.Map[String, mutable.Set[String]]().withDefaultValue(mutable.Set())

     while (resultSet.next()) {
       val brand = resultSet.getString("brand")
       val model = resultSet.getString("model")
       existingModels(brand) += model
     }

     resultSet.close()
     statement.close()

     // Convert mutable map to an immutable map
     existingModels.map { case (k, v) => k -> v.toSet }.toMap
   }
   ```

2. **Process entries and batch insert new models**:
   ```scala
   def processEntries(
       entries: Seq[(String, String, Int, String)], // (brand, model, year, description)
       existingModels: Map[String, Set[String]],
       connection: Connection
   ): Unit = {
     val insertQuery = "INSERT INTO car_models (brand, model, year, description) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)"
     val preparedStatement = connection.prepareStatement(insertQuery)
     val batchSize = 500
     var count = 0

     connection.setAutoCommit(false) // Disable auto-commit for batch processing

     entries.foreach { case (brand, model, year, description) =>
       if (!existingModels.getOrElse(brand, Set()).contains(model)) {
         preparedStatement.setString(1, brand)
         preparedStatement.setString(2, model)
         preparedStatement.setInt(3, year)
         preparedStatement.setString(4, description)
         preparedStatement.addBatch()

         count += 1

         if (count % batchSize == 0) {
           preparedStatement.executeBatch()
           connection.commit()
         }
       }
     }

     // Execute any remaining entries in the batch
     if (count % batchSize != 0) {
       preparedStatement.executeBatch()
       connection.commit()
     }

     preparedStatement.close()
   }
   ```

3. **Main Method Flow**:
   - Fetch existing models.
   - For each car entry, check if it exists in memory (`Map`).
   - Batch insert the new entries.

   ```scala
   import com.zaxxer.hikari.{HikariConfig, HikariDataSource}

   val config = new HikariConfig()
   config.setJdbcUrl("jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydb")
   config.setUsername("user")
   config.setPassword("password")
   val dataSource = new HikariDataSource(config)

   val connection = dataSource.getConnection

   try {
     val existingModels = fetchExistingModels(connection)

     // Load the 100,000 entries (from file or other source)
     val entries: Seq[(String, String, Int, String)] = loadEntriesFromFile()

     // Process the entries in batches
     processEntries(entries, existingModels, connection)
   } finally {
     connection.close()
     dataSource.close()
   }
   ```

### 5. **Further Optimizations**:
   - **Indexing**: Ensure that the `brand` and `model` columns in your SQL table are indexed, especially if the dataset is large. This will improve query and insert performance.
   - **Prepared Statements**: Always use prepared statements for executing queries and inserts. This reduces the overhead of SQL parsing and improves performance, especially in batch operations.
   - **Parallel Processing**: Depending on the complexity of your dataset and the database server capacity, you can further split the 100,000 entries into smaller chunks and process them concurrently across multiple threads.

By following this approach, you minimize database calls, batch process inserts, and make use of in-memory validations, which will drastically improve the performance of handling such a large number of entries.
